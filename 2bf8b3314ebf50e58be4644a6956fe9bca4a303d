- remove %{jdkdir} before doing a link avoids making it at the directory
  if earlier version is not uninstalled cleanly (e.g. when there are some
  changes in jre .properties)
- changed default font.properties to font.properties.RedHat.6.1 to avoid
  unnatural big gaps between text lines
- release 0.2
